            Star Trek Continues is a fan-created science fiction series set in the Star Trek universe produced by Trek
            Continues Inc., Far From Home, and Dracogen. The series is an unofficial direct continuation of the third
            and last season of Star Trek: The Original Series, whose visual and storytelling features have been
            reproduced to recreate the same look-and-feel.

            As with all such Star Trek fan productions, use of copyrighted and trademarked properties from the original
            series was allowed so long as the production is not-for-profit. Part of the funds necessary to produce the
            episodes were raised through a successful Kickstarter campaign, to which almost three thousand backers
            contributed.

            Star Trek Continues won a Geekie Award for "Best Web Series" in 2014 and has been very positively received
            by the critics, who praised the quality of the production, stating that the series has set a new standard
            for Star Trek fan productions.
